# X-Bot-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Supervised Machine Learning for Detecting Bot Accounts on X (formerly Twitter)

# Overview
This repository contains the final project for MGT 661: Artificial Intelligence & Business Analytics, focused on detecting automated bot accounts on X (Twitter) using supervised machine learning techniques.
Social Media Bots (SMBs) pose growing risks to brand perception, consumer trust, and the spread of misinformation. This project applies data‑driven machine learning models to classify accounts as human or bot using publicly available metadata from the Twitter Account Dataset.
The final version of this project reflects feedback and suggestions from fellow classmate Ben S., which significantly improved the clarity, structure, and business relevance of the analysis.

# Objectives 
Learn about the advatnages of utlizing AI and its tools in a business environment. 
Develop a machine‑learning pipeline capable of differentiating human users from bot accounts on X.
Evaluate multiple supervised learning algorithms and compare performance.
Address class imbalance using SMOTE to improve bot‑detection accuracy.
Provide insights into features that influence model predictions.
Demonstrate the business risks posed by bots and how ML models can help mitigate them.
